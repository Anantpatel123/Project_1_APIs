# Project_1_APIs


### Project Summary: 

##### Product search using ** Best Buy AND YouTube API**. 

    1. User picks a product category and inputs desired product name into the search box.

    2. The combination of category and search term(s) are used in an API call to request results 
       from Best Buy.

    3. Based on the API request, an array of product's details or data (called object) are returned.

    4. This returned object are used to populate a list box (in the form of dropdown menu bar) so 
       that the user can choose a specific product from that list box (or dropdown).

    5. Once the user chooses a specific product from the dropdown, it displays a product details and 
       image using Best Buy API.

    6. That specific product then is used in another API call to YouTube, which returns and embeds videos 
       of reviews, installments, and unboxings of that specific product.

    7. The specific product is also pushed to a firebase database which is used to display a table of all 
       recently searched products.
